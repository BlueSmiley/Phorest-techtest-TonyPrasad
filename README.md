# Phorest Tech Project - Tony Prasad

This is my submission for the Phorest tech project. The main task is to receive user input and make a GET and POST
request to the Phorest API. Since the task was very simple I decided to try do it in React for a couple of reasons:

1. Easier for others to review code as familiar with the language
2. Easy to add UI functionality with React which seemed like a decent improvement to add if time since base task was simple
3. Good experience to continue learning React personally

As you might see 2. is an ongoing process, but the base functionality should be working. Hopefully by the point this is
submitted it should be in a decent state. I am not 100% familiar with React yet and frontend design so things may 
take me longer than expected

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
This is what I used locally for testing and how I expect others to run the program. I presume npm run build also works
but I have not tested it.

## Things I plan to do before submission

I may not be able to do all of these in time but here are some tasks I hope to do before submission
They are listed in order of priority and how easy to finish and I may have missed some tasks that might be useful
This serves as a simple TODO for me and also hopefully helps people reviewing my code, my thought process and how I 
split work.

1. Split display of GET results into own card like widget
2. Add button to easily add voucher to queried clients 
3. Simpler date format entry
4. Validation of fields to reduce invalid values
5. Button to swap between the POST and GET functionalities
